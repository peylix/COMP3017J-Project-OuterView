\section{Preface}

The intended readers of this document are primarily technical interviewing platform developers, 
product managers, and other stakeholders involved in the design, development, and implementation 
of collaborative technical interviewing software systems. The purpose of this document is to 
provide a comprehensive overview of the system requirements and customer problem statement, 
clearly defining the requirements and capabilities of the platform to guide the development team 
in creating solutions that meet the needs of interviewers and candidates.

This document has gone through several versions, each improving and expanding on the previous 
version. The rationale for creating a new version is to incorporate stakeholder feedback, update

\section{System Specification}
\subsection{Customer Problem Statement}

As a customer, I am facing the problem of conducting technical interviews in an inefficient and time-consuming manner. Traditional interview methods often involve face-to-face meetings, which can be challenging due to time constraints, geographical limitations, and the need for specialized equipment. For instance, scheduling interviews with candidates from different time zones or remote locations can be difficult, and setting up a suitable environment for coding tasks can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate a candidate’s skills and knowledge without a proper platform for live collaboration and code execution.

To address these challenges, I suggest a software system that provides a live, collaborative environment for both interviewers and candidates to write, execute, and debug code together. This system should help candidates easily share their skills and support multiple programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Java. It should also have video and audio interviewing functions, scheduling and management features for interviewers, a virtual whiteboard, and the ability to evaluate a candidate’s code with automated test cases. Additionally, the system should allow me to replay interviews for future reference, helping me to better assess candidate performance and make more informed decisions.

By implementing this software system, I believe it will significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of technical interviews, enabling me to identify the best candidates more quickly and accurately. This will not only save time and resources but also enhance the overall quality of the interview process, leading to better matches between candidates and employers.

\subsection{Glossary of Terms}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Technical Interview Platform:} A website designed to facilitate live, collaborative technical interviews between interviewers and candidates.

  \item \textbf{Programming Language:} A set of rules and conventions used to create computer programs. 
  \item \textbf{Video and Audio Interviewing:} Functionality that allows interviewers and candidates to communicate via video and audio during the interview process. 
  \item \textbf{Scheduling and Management:} Features that enable interviewers to schedule and manage interviews efficiently. 
  \item \textbf{Virtual Whiteboard:} A digital whiteboard that allows interviewers and candidates to visualize their technical conversations during interviews. 
  \item \textbf{Automated Test Cases:} Pre-written tests that evaluate a candidate’s code for correctness and efficiency. 
  \item \textbf{Playback Function:} A feature that allows interviewers to replay the entire interview after it has ended. 
\end{itemize}

\section{System Design}

\subsection{User Interface Design}

\subsubsection*{User Interface Prototype}

\subsubsection*{User Interface Description}

The user interface is divided into four main parts: \textit{Sign Up/Login}, \textit{Joining a Meeting}, \textit{Booking a Meeting}, and a \textit{Meeting Schedule}. The following descriptions provide a brief overview of each feature included and offer preliminary models of some key features.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Joining a Meeting:} After clicking to join the meeting, the meeting details will be displayed in a pop-up window.
  \item \textbf{Meeting Schedule:} The meeting schedule contains the meetings that users will participate in in order of meeting start time. After clicking on any of the meetings, the meeting details will appear and the meeting details will be displayed in a pop-up window.
  \item \textbf{Meeting Details:} The content in this pop-up window includes: \textit{meeting name}, \textit{meeting duration}, \textit{start time and end time of the meeting}, \textit{initiator of this meeting}, \textit{canceling the meeting}, \textit{editing the meeting} and \textit{entering the meeting}. The user clicks \textit{Enter Meeting} in the pop-up window to enter the meeting room; or clicks the \textit{Return} button in the upper left corner to close the pop-up window. Only the meeting initiator is allowed to click the \textit{Cancel Meeting} and \textit{Edit Meeting} buttons below the pop-up window; invitees cannot click these two buttons. After clicking \textit{Cancel Meeting}, the meeting will be deleted; after clicking \textit{Edit Meeting}, the page will jump to the information filling page in the \textit{appointed meeting} for modification.
  \item \textbf{Booking a Meeting:} After clicking to schedule a meeting, the user needs to fill in the following information for this meeting in a new page: \textit{meeting name (the default name is "username's scheduled meeting")}, \textit{start time}, \textit{duration of the meeting (options are: 30min, 45min, 60min)} and \textit{the invitees}. This column requires an ID. The user clicks \textit{Complete Appointment} below the page to end information filling. After completed, the user will return to the main page and see the newly scheduled meeting in the \textit{Meeting Schedule} on the right side of the page.

\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Team Agreement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Meeting Time:} Every Monday at 9pm and every Friday at 5pm.
  \item \textbf{Code Managing:} This project uses git to manage the source code and other related resources. 
  A private repository on GitHub is used for hosting code and team collaboration. Commit message should be 
  clear and follow the convention like \par \verb|<type>[optional scope]: <description>|. Any changes that may be 
  deemed destructive should be made on a separate branch and then merged to the main branch after stabilized 
  and being reviewed by at least one other team member.
  \item \textbf{Details for Cooperation:} A clear API document with detailed comments should be provided by the 
  team members who is responsible for the backend. The backend developers and frontend developers should work 
  closely together.
\end{itemize}
