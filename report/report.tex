\section{System Specification}
\subsection{Customer Problem Statement}

As a customer, I am facing the problem of conducting technical interviews in an inefficient and time-consuming manner. Traditional interview methods often involve face-to-face meetings, which can be challenging due to time constraints, geographical limitations, and the need for specialized equipment. For instance, scheduling interviews with candidates from different time zones or remote locations can be difficult, and setting up a suitable environment for coding tasks can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate a candidateâ€™s skills and knowledge without a proper platform for live collaboration and code execution.

To address these challenges, I suggest a software system that provides a live, collaborative environment for both interviewers and candidates to write, execute, and debug code together. This system should help candidates easily share their skills and support multiple programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Java. It should also have video and audio interviewing functions, scheduling and management features for interviewers, a virtual whiteboard, and the ability to evaluate a candidateâ€™s code with automated test cases. Additionally, the system should allow me to replay interviews for future reference, helping me to better assess candidate performance and make more informed decisions.

By implementing this software system, I believe it will significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of technical interviews, enabling me to identify the best candidates more quickly and accurately. This will not only save time and resources but also enhance the overall quality of the interview process, leading to better matches between candidates and employers.

\subsection{Glossary of Terms}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Technical Interview Platform:} A website designed to facilitate live, collaborative technical interviews between interviewers and candidates. 
  \item \textbf{Browser-based IDE:} A web-based integrated development environment that allows candidates to share their coding skills during interviews. 
  \item \textbf{Programming Language:} A set of rules and conventions used to create computer programs. 
  \item \textbf{Video and Audio Interviewing:} Functionality that allows interviewers and candidates to communicate via video and audio during the interview process. 
  \item \textbf{Scheduling and Management:} Features that enable interviewers to schedule and manage interviews efficiently. 
  \item \textbf{Virtual Whiteboard:} A digital whiteboard that allows interviewers and candidates to visualize their technical conversations during interviews. 
  \item \textbf{Automated Test Cases:} Pre-written tests that evaluate a candidateâ€™s code for correctness and efficiency. 
  \item \textbf{Playback Function:} A feature that allows interviewers to replay the entire interview after it has ended. 
  \item \textbf{Not Start:} The meeting has not yet started, and the interviewee is waiting for the meeting.
  \item \textbf{In progress:} The meeting is currently in progress, and the interviewees are in the meeting status.
  \item \textbf{Completed:} The meeting has ended, and the interview is now in its current state.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Description of Responsibilities}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Meeting:} The Meeting class is a basic entity class. Its attributes include name, id, start time, and duration continue. The Meeting class contains the following methods: geter() method for each attribute and seter() method for each attribute excluding ID.
  \item \textbf{MeetingService:} The MeetingService class is a basic entity class. Its properties are instance objects of the Meeting class. The MeetingService class includes the following methods: methods for browsing meeting lists, methods for browsing meeting information, methods for modifying meeting information, methods for adding and removing meetings.
  \item \textbf{User:} The User class is a basic entity class, which is the parent class of the Interviewee class and the Interviewer class. Its properties include uid, name, email, password and type filled in during registration, where type is used to distinguish whether the user is an internee or an internee.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Architecture and System Design}

\subsubsection*{Architectural Styles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Frontend:} The front-end uses the React framework to generate SPA (Single Page Application), which requests the back-end to return JSON data and then renders it by the front-end framework. The front end uses tsx based on typescript to generate html templates, typescript is used to execute the script language and control the front-end logic, and moduleCSS+tailwindCSS is used to generate the style sheet. Use the webRTC interface that comes with the browser to read the audio and video streams. After entering the room, the front and back ends will use socket.io to establish a full-duplex P2P connection.
  \item \textbf{Backend:} The backend of the platform makes use of Flask as its framework to support all the functionalities, from creating an account to making a meeting appointment. It uses SQL Alchemy to make it easier and clearer to generate database models. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{UML Package Diagram of Subsystems}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \center
  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{diagrams/package-diagram.png}
  \caption{Package Diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Database Schema of the System}
There are three tables in the database: \verb|user|, \verb|reservation| and \verb|reservation\_participant|. The \verb|user| table is for storing data related to the user account of this platform (user ID, password, name, type of user, etc.), with \verb|user\_id| as its primary key, identifying each user. The \verb|reservation| table is for storing data related to the information of meetings. Its attributes involve the name, start time, end time, state, details and date of a meeting. The table uses an auto-increment ID serving as the primary key to identify each meeting. The \verb|reservation\_participant| table is a helper table for remembering the relationship of users and meetings, that is, the number of users involved in a meeting. It has an auto-increment ID as its primary key.

The design of the database meets the requirements of the Boyce-Codd normal form. Each table has a primary key, and all attributes in each table are functionally dependent on their respective primary keys, which are also superkeys. This eliminates redundancy and updates anomalies by ensuring every non-trivial functional dependency is on a superkey.

\subsubsection*{Global Control Flow of the System}
The user registers an account, and the system backend creates a new account and stores it in the database. When the user logs in, the backend verifies that the password is correct. If the password is incorrect, an error message is returned. If the password is correct, the user enters the main page.

On the main page, the system displays the user's nickname and identity, as well as a button to return to the login interface, displays user-related meeting information, and the interviewer additionally displays a button to schedule a meeting.

When the interviewer clicks the reservation button, the system will jump to the reservation page. The system will display the meeting-related information fill-in column. After the interviewer fills in the relevant information, click the reservation button to create the meeting. The system will navigate to the main meeting page and re-render the meeting information.

When the user clicks the meeting information icon, the system will jump to the meeting information page, where the system displays meeting-related information.

On the meeting information page, the interviewer clicks the Cancel Meeting button to cancel the meeting, and the system navigates to the main page and re-renders the meeting information.

On the meeting information page, the interviewer clicks the Edit meeting button to edit the meeting, and the system navigates to the reservation page. After the interviewer refills the information, the system navigates to the main page and re-renders the meeting information.

In the meeting information page, the user clicks the Enter meeting button, and the system navigates to the meeting page.

After clicking to join the interview, the backend will verify whether the user is in this interview. If not in the interview, the user is allowed to enter the interview room page.

After entering the interview room page, the interviewer/interviewer needs to click a button to turn on his or her camera and microphone.

If the network is normal, the connection will be established and the interviewer/interviewer can see the other party's ID, screen and share the IDE.

\subsubsection*{Hardware Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Minimal configuration:} 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The device can run the chrome browser.
    \item The device can access the Internet (for P2P connection establishment)
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Optimal configuration:} Available camera/microphone to enable video and audio streaming, called via Chrome browser.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Algorithms and Data Structures in the System: HashTable}
\begin{lstlisting}
// Save all connections
const clients = {};
setInterval(() => {
for (const client in clients) {
  clients[client].ws.emit('updateAllClients', {
    data: Object.keys(clients),
    })
  }
}, 2000)
\end{lstlisting}
User (client) related information, including socket instance object, room id and user id are stored in the clients object.

The key is the user's id, and the value is user-related information.
\begin{lstlisting}
switch (message.type) {
  case "connect":
    // Save the connected clients
    clientID = message.data.myID;
    roomID = message.data.roomID
    console.log(`${clientID} has connected in ${roomID}`)
    clients[clientID] = {
      clientID,
      roomID,
      ws,
    };
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
When a user initiates a video stream push to another user, the socket instance object of the other user is obtained through the clientID, and the emit method is called to trigger the event.

Using hashTable to store information makes the structure clear and improves access efficiency.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Interface Design}


\subsubsection*{User Interface Description}

The user interface is divided into four main parts: \textit{Sign Up/Login}, \textit{Joining a Meeting}, \textit{Booking a Meeting}, and a \textit{Meeting Schedule}. The following descriptions provide a brief overview of each feature included and offer preliminary models of some key features.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Joining a Meeting:} After clicking to join the meeting, the meeting details will be displayed in a pop-up window.
  \item \textbf{Meeting Schedule:} The meeting schedule contains the meetings that users will participate in in order of meeting start time. After clicking on any of the meetings, the meeting details will appear and the meeting details will be displayed in a pop-up window.
  \item \textbf{Meeting Details:} The content in this pop-up window includes: \textit{meeting name}, \textit{meeting duration}, \textit{start time and end time of the meeting}, \textit{initiator of this meeting}, \textit{canceling the meeting}, \textit{editing the meeting} and \textit{entering the meeting}. The user clicks \textit{Enter Meeting} in the pop-up window to enter the meeting room; or clicks the \textit{Return} button in the upper left corner to close the pop-up window. Only the meeting initiator is allowed to click the \textit{Cancel Meeting} and \textit{Edit Meeting} buttons below the pop-up window; invitees cannot click these two buttons. After clicking \textit{Cancel Meeting}, the meeting will be deleted; after clicking \textit{Edit Meeting}, the page will jump to the information filling page in the \textit{appointed meeting} for modification.
  \item \textbf{Booking a Meeting:} After clicking to schedule a meeting, the user needs to fill in the following information for this meeting in a new page: \textit{meeting name (the default name is "username's scheduled meeting")}, \textit{start time}, \textit{duration of the meeting (options are: 30min, 45min, 60min)} and \textit{the invitees}. This column requires an ID. The user clicks \textit{Complete Appointment} below the page to end information filling. After completed, the user will return to the main page and see the newly scheduled meeting in the \textit{Meeting Schedule} on the right side of the page.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Team Agreement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Meeting Time:} Every Monday at 9pm and every Friday at 5pm.
  \item \textbf{Code Management:} This project uses git to manage the source code and other related resources. 
  A private repository on GitHub is used for hosting code and team collaboration. Commit message should be 
  clear and follow the convention like \par \verb|<type>[optional scope]: <description>|. Any changes that may be 
  deemed destructive should be made on a separate branch and then merged to the main branch after stabilized 
  and being reviewed by at least one other team member. All backend code should be tested using Apifox before 
  submitted.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \center
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{diagrams/apifox.png}
    \caption{Using Apifox to test APIs}
  \end{figure}
  \item \textbf{Details for Cooperation:} A clear API document with detailed comments should be provided by the 
  team members who is responsible for the backend. The backend developers and frontend developers should work 
  closely together.
  \item \textbf{Overall Management:} In order to better manage tasks and project progress, a Gantt chart was 
  created so that the phased progress of the project and the task allocation of each member can be clearly seen. 
  Not only does this help track overall progress, but it also provides clear direction for team members so they can 
  better understand the overall framework of the project and their own roles.
